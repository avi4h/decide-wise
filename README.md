# Decide Wise

**Decide Wise** is a simple web tool designed to assist in making informed decisions about whether a software feature is worth building or not.

## How It Works

**Decide Wise** uses a set of predefined parameters with associated weights to calculate a decision score. Here are the key parameters:

1. User Proportion: What proportion of users are likely to use the feature?
2. User Importance: How important are the target users to the existing product?
3. Feature Value: How valuable is the feature to the target users?
4. Technical Effort: What is the time, technical effort, and cost to build the feature?
5. Negative Impact: How much potential technical risk can the feature bring to the rest of the product?
6. Operational Complexity: What is the operational/business complexity of the feature?
