## About

In software product development, deciding which features to build can often be a subjective and complex process. **Decide Wise** simplifies this decision-making by considering key parameters, such as user proportion, technical effort, user importance, feature value, operational complexity, and potential negative impact. By assigning weights and values to these parameters, the app calculates a score that can guide your feature development choices.

## How It Works

**Decide Wise** uses a set of predefined parameters with associated weights to calculate a decision score based on the user's input. Here are the key parameters:

1. User Proportion: What proportion of users are likely to use the feature?
2. User Importance: How important are the target users to the existing product?
3. Feature Value: How valuable is the feature to the target users?
4. Technical Effort: What is the time, technical effort, and cost to build the feature?
5. Negative Impact: How much potential technical risk can the feature bring to the rest of the product?
6. Operational Complexity: What is the operational/business complexity of the feature?

You can adjust these parameters using a slider, and the app will instantly calculate a decision score. The app's logic also provides a recommendation based on the calculated score, helping you decide whether to proceed with the feature or not.
